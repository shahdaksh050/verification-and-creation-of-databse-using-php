# verification-and-creation-of-databse-using-php
This PHP script attempts to connect to a MySQL server, checks whether a specific database exists, and if it doesn't, creates it. The script is designed with error handling to ensure smooth operations. If any connection or database errors occur, they are handled by exceptions and displayed to the user.
